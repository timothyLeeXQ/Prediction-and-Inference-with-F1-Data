>(2) [25pts] Now we move on to prediction. Fit a model using data from 1950:2010, and predict drivers that come in second place between 2011 and 2017. [Remember, this is a predictive model where variables are selected as the subset that is best at predicting the target variable and not for theoretical reasons. This means that your model should not overfit and most likely be different from the model in (1).]
>From your fitted model:
- describe your model, and explain how you selected the features that were selected
- provide statistics that show how good your model is at predicting, and how well it performed predicting second places in races between 2011 and 2017
- the most important variable in (1) is bound to also be included in your predictive model. Provide marginal effects or some metric of importance for this variable and make an explicit comparison of this value with the values that you obtained in (1). How different are they? Why are they different?
