#### An Informal Theory of Formula One Strategy and Performance

>(1) [25pts] Your first task is inferential. You are going to try to explain why a driver arrives in second place in a race between 1950 and 2010. Fit a model using features that make theoretical sense to describe F1 racing between 1950 and 2010. Clean the data, and transform it as necessary, including dealing with missing data. [Remember, this will almost necessarily be an overfit model where variables are selected because they make sense to explain F1 races between 1950 and 2010, and not based on algorithmic feature selection]
From your fitted model:
>- describe your model, and explain why each feature was selected
- provide statistics that show how well the model fits the data
- what is the most important variable in your model? How did you determine that?
- provide some marginal effects for the variable that you identified as the most important in the model, and interpret it in the context of F1 races: in other words, give us the story that the data is providing you about drivers that come in second place
- does it make sense to think of it as an "explanation" for drivers arriving in second place? or is it simply an association we observe in the data?
